This lab demonstrated the difference between an SBOM ('what's in the code') and an HBOM ('what's on the board'). My analysis showed that software risk (like the CVEs in Part 2) and hardware risk (like the ESP32-S3 vulnerability in Part 3) are deeply connected. A vulnerability in a hardware component (like the Wi-Fi module) could allow an attacker to bypass software security. Likewise, a software vulnerability could be used to exploit a trusted hardware component (like the display). This shows why security requires visibility into the entire supply chain, both digital and physical.
